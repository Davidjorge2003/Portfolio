            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Born in Spain, located in Montreal, I'm a passionate person with a strong interest in programming. During my 3-year DEC at Vanier College, I had the opportunity to work on many personal projects where I collaborated with other developers. These experiences helped me grow both personally and professionally, fostering my ability to work well with others and adapt to different situations. I'm eager to take on new challenges and continue growing.</p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>Some of the skills I have gained over the years, thanks to my 3-year DEC and my personal projects, are HTML, CSS, C#, Flutter, Java, .NET MAUI, XAML, PHP, MySQL, and basic ethical hacking knowledge. During this 3-year DEC, I also had the opportunity to improve other skills, such as adapting quickly to different situations, learning new things quickly, and working effectively with all types of people. Lastly, I can speak Spanish and English, and I am proficient in reading and listening to French, as well as in reading and listening to Portuguese.</p>
